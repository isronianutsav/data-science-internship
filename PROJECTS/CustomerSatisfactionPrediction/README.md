# 🐍🙂 Customer Satisfaction Prediction System (Flask Web App)

This repository contains a **Flask-based machine learning web application** for predicting **customer satisfaction** levels.  
The system uses trained **classification models** to determine whether a customer is **Satisfied** or **Not Satisfied** based on multiple service-related factors.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The Customer Satisfaction Prediction System demonstrates how **classification-based machine learning models** can be deployed using Flask.  
User inputs are collected through a web interface, processed by trained models, and the prediction results are displayed in real time.

This project is suitable for:
- Data Science & Machine Learning internships  
- Classification model deployment practice  
- Flask backend learning  
- Academic and portfolio projects  

---

## ⚙️ Application Workflow
- User submits customer and travel-related details via a web form  
- Backend processes encoded feature values  
- Classification models generate satisfaction predictions  
- Results are displayed dynamically on the web page  
- Deployed as a template-based Flask web application using Jinja2 templates
---

## 🛠 Libraries & Frameworks Used

### 🐍 `Flask`
Used to create the web application, manage routes, handle HTTP requests, and serve prediction results dynamically.

### 🐍 `render_template`
Used to render HTML templates and display prediction outputs on the frontend.

### 🐍 `request`
Used to collect and process user input submitted through web forms.

### 🐍 `joblib`
Used to load pre-trained machine learning classification models efficiently into the Flask application.

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models Used
- Support Vector Classifier (SVC)  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier  

Both models independently predict customer satisfaction to allow comparative analysis.

## ⚙️ Technical Details
- **Backend:** Flask (Python)
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS
- **Model Type:** Classification
- **Input Method:** Web-based form
- **Output:** Satisfied / Not Satisfied
- **Development Mode:** Debug enabled

---

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Run the Flask application:
```bash
python app.py
```
2. Open the local server URL in a browser  
3. Enter customer details and view satisfaction predictions
