# 💻 Laptop Price Prediction

This project focuses on **predicting laptop prices** based on various hardware and brand-related features using **data analysis and machine learning techniques**.  
It was developed as part of my **Data Science Internship** to understand how different specifications influence laptop pricing.

The complete workflow is implemented in **Python using Jupyter Notebook**, covering data exploration, visualization, preprocessing, and model building.
