# 🏧 Simple ATM Simulation (Python)

This project is a **command-line based ATM simulation** built using **Python and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts.  
It demonstrates how real-world systems like an ATM can be modeled using classes, objects, and methods.

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Make sure Python is installed (Python 3.x recommended)
2. Open terminal or command prompt
3. Run the file:
   ```bash
   python ATM.py
## 🧪 Sample Flow
```bash
Welcome to Simple ATM!
Commands: 1=Check Balance, 2=Withdraw, 3=Deposit, 0=Exit

Enter command: 1
Balance: ₹10000

Enter command: 2
Enter amount to withdraw: 2000
Withdrawn ₹2000. New balance: ₹8000
