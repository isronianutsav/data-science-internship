# 🐍🚲 Used Bike Price Prediction System (Flask Web App)

This repository contains a **Flask-based web application** for predicting the **price of used bikes** using machine learning models.  
The system takes user input through a web interface and returns predicted prices generated by trained regression models.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The Used Bike Price Prediction System is designed to demonstrate how **machine learning models can be deployed as a web application**.  
It integrates backend prediction logic with a frontend user interface, allowing real-time price estimation based on bike attributes.

This project is suitable for:
- Data Science / Machine Learning internships
- Flask backend learning
- ML model deployment practice
- Academic and portfolio projects

---

## ⚙️ Application Workflow
- User enters bike details through a web form
- Backend processes input data
- Trained ML models generate price predictions
- Results are displayed on the web page

---

## 🛠 Libraries & Frameworks Used

### 🐍 `Flask`
Flask is a **lightweight Python web framework** used to:
- Create the web application
- Handle routing and HTTP requests
- Connect backend logic with frontend templates
- Serve dynamic prediction results to users
- Deployed as a template-based Flask web application using Jinja2 templates
---

### 🐍 `render_template`
Used for:
- Rendering HTML templates
- Displaying dynamic data such as predictions on the frontend

---

### 🐍 `request`
Used for:
- Collecting form data submitted by users
- Handling POST requests from HTML forms

---

### 🐍 `url_for`
Used for:
- Generating URLs dynamically
- Linking Flask routes with HTML templates safely

---

### 🐍 `joblib`
Joblib is used for:
- Loading pre-trained machine learning models
- Efficient deserialization of ML models
- Integrating trained models into production-ready applications

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models Used
- **Linear Regression Model**
- **Support Vector Regression (SVR) Model**

Both models are loaded and used to generate independent predictions for comparison.

---

## ⚙️ Technical Details
- **Backend:** Flask (Python)
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS
- **Model Type:** Regression
- **Input Method:** Web form
- **Output:** Predicted bike price (₹)
- **Debug Mode:** Enabled during development

---

## 🔑 Execution Requirements
- Python 3.x installed
- Flask installed
- Joblib installed
- Trained model files available
- Web browser for frontend interaction

---

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Open terminal in the project directory  
2. Run the Flask application:
```bash
python app.py
```
3.Open the browser and access the local server URL
4.Enter bike details and view predictions

## 📚 Learning Outcomes
