# 📊 Data Science Internship Projects

This repository showcases the **end-to-end projects** developed during my **Data Science Internship**.  
Each project applies data science, machine learning, or system-level programming concepts to **real-world problem statements**, with a strong focus on **practical implementation and deployment**.

The projects include **prediction systems, classification systems, simulations, and network-based applications**, demonstrating how data-driven and system-driven solutions are built.

## 🚀 Projects Developed During Internship

### 🔹 Used Bike Price Prediction System
A machine learning–based prediction system that estimates the **market price of used bikes** based on factors such as brand, age, power, ownership, and usage history.  
The system uses regression models and is deployed as a **Flask web application** for real-time predictions.

---

### 🔹 Laptop Price Prediction System
An end-to-end ML deployment project that predicts **laptop prices** based on hardware and software specifications.  
Multiple regression models are used, and predictions are served through a **Flask-based web interface**.

---

### 🔹 Customer Satisfaction Prediction System
A classification-based project that predicts whether a customer is **Satisfied** or **Not Satisfied** based on travel and service-related features.  
The system compares predictions from multiple classifiers and is deployed using **Flask**.

---

### 🔹 ATM Simulation System
A Python-based application that simulates **ATM operations** such as balance inquiry, cash withdrawal, and deposit.  
This project demonstrates logical flow control, class-based program design, and real-world banking operation simulation.

---

### 🔹 UDP-Based Chat Application (SOCK_DGRAM)
A **network-based chat application** implemented using **UDP socket programming (SOCK_DGRAM)**.  
The application enables message exchange between systems connected to the same network, demonstrating low-level networking concepts such as IP addressing, ports, and connectionless communication.
