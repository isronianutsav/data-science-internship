## Pandas

This folder contains Pandas-based data analysis and exploratory data analysis (EDA) work using real datasets.  
The focus is on understanding, cleaning, transforming, and preparing data for machine learning workflows.

All work is done using Jupyter Notebook, combining code execution with outputs for better understanding and revision.

### Topics Covered
- Reading CSV files
- DataFrame basics
- Data inspection:
  - `df.info()`
  - `df.describe()`
- Data cleaning:
  - Removing duplicates
  - Handling missing values
  - Dropping unnecessary columns
- Filtering and sorting data
- Column encoding (categorical → numerical)
- Feature selection and data preparation for ML
- Handling numerical and categorical features together

### Machine Learning Preparation
- Preparing datasets for:
  - Linear Regression
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Decision Tree
  - Ensemble Learning models
- Understanding how clean data impacts model performance
- Structuring features in correct format for training and prediction

This folder also includes a **Used Bikes price prediction example**, demonstrating how Pandas-based data preparation directly supports machine learning model development.
